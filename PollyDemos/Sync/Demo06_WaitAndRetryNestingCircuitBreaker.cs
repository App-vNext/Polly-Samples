    /// After too many failures, breaks the circuit for a period, during which it blocks calls + fails fast.
    /// - protects the downstream system from too many calls if it's really struggling (reduces load, so it can recover)
    /// - allows the client to get a fail response _fast, not wait for ages, if downstream is awol.
    /// 
    /// Obervations from this demo:
    /// Note how after the circuit decides to break, subsequent calls fail faster.
    /// Note how breaker gives underlying system time to recover ...
    /// ... by the time circuit closes again, underlying system has recovered!
